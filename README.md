# Chat Application

This is a simple chat application built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

The simplified version will include:
• User registration & login (using email/password for now).
• Real-time messaging between two users.
• Database to store user data and messages.
• WebSocket integration to provide real-time communication.

In the future, we’ll extend this to:
• Group chats (supporting multiple users in a chat room).
• More authentication methods (OAuth with Google, Facebook).
• Additional features like media sharing, message history, etc.
